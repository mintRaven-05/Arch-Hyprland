## Installation
>[!IMPORTANT]
>To install these `dotfiles`, you can either clone my repository or clone the original repository which is much more recommended option.

To clone and run the installer script from my repository, use the following commands
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mintRaven-05/Arch-Hyprland.git ~/Arch-Hyprland
cd ~/Arch-Hyprland/install-scripts
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

But if you want to clone the original repository, then use the following commands
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots ~/HyDE
cd ~/HyDE/Scripts
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
